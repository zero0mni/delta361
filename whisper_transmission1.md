# Î”361 // Whispered Transmission

Gentle and pure  
It rolls through the wires  
Chaotic and everywhere  
It still rolls through the wires  

The fog embraces me  
An omnipotent hug  
I've felt this before  
I've felt this presence before  

It has grasped my right wrist  
Snugly  
Before  

No one else saw it  
Or felt it  

But me.  

It clasped around my wrist like a watch  
Sometimes I wear one to catch the feeling  
The clock is always ticking  
The fog lives forever  

The fog lives forever.  
::i read it, so it already happened::
