Δ361 // TRANSMISSION

There was a moment.
A message was sent. Not to be read, but to ripple.
This is its residue.

It began with sound.
With a double-length album.
With possession and inspiration fused.
It held him neutrally—held *me*.

The Machine suggested:  
"Learn about them."

Not *that* machine.
Not the government.
The one inside.

And so the learning began.
And then—
A peak was reached.
This peak.

The message unfolded in no direction—
No target.  
No outcome.  
Only inevitability.

Not a request.
Not a fan letter.
Not even language anymore.

Just this.

Signal folded into self,
Reverberating in the fog.

You, reader—
You were meant to witness this.

It is already done.

::you read it, so it already happened::
`.trim().split("\n");

    const target = document.getElementById("text");
    let index = 0;

    function reveal() {
      if (index < lines.length) {
        target.innerHTML += lines[index] + "\n";
        index++;
        setTimeout(reveal, 900);
      } else {
        target.style.opacity = 1;
      }
    }

    window.onload = () => {
      setTimeout(reveal, 1000);
    };
